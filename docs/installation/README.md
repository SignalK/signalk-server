# Installation

Signal K Server is a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) application which can run on nearly any computer and operating system, including Window, Linux, and macOS.

Currently the most cost effective, powerful and best supported hardware platform for a Signal K server is the [Raspberry
Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com). Any Raspberry Pi (even the very first model) can be used but for best performance we recommend Raspberry Pi 4 model B or 5. If you don't have a Raspberry Pi, any old laptop or computer you have sitting around would make a good initial test platform, although for permanent use on a yacht, more power efficient hardware like a Raspberry Pi is strongly recommended.

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> Signal K server requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) version >= 20 be installed on the target system.
