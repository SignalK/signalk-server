| `SIGNALK_NODE_SETTINGS`          | Override the path to the settings file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `SIGNALK_NODE_CONFIG_DIR`        | Override the path to find server configuration. Includes all run-time changing content: configuration files, plugins, plugin configuration files, webapps, and so forth.                                                                                                                                           |
| `SKIP_NODE_VERSION_CHECK`        | Skip the Node.js minimum version check. This is not recommended, but allows you to attempt to run the server on unsuppported versions of Node. (Added in v2.14.1)                                                                                                                                                  |
| `HTTP_RATE_LIMITS`               | Override HTTP rate limits. Provide overrides like `api=1000,loginStatus=1000,login=1000` (optionally `windowMs=600000`). Useful for tests and unusual deployments.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `BACKPRESSURE_ENTER`             | WebSocket backpressure threshold in bytes to enter backpressure mode _(default is 524288 / 512KB)_. When a client's send buffer exceeds this, the server switches to accumulating only latest values per path.                                                                                                     |
| `BACKPRESSURE_EXIT`              | WebSocket backpressure threshold in bytes to exit backpressure mode _(default is 1024 / 1KB)_. When the buffer drains below this, accumulated values are flushed. Primarily for testing.                                                                                                                           |
