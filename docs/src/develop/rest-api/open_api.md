# REST APIs

REST APIs were introduced in Signal K server version 2 to provide a way for applications and plugins perform operations and ensure that the Signal K data model is consistent.

The OpenAPI definitions can be found under _Documentation -> OpenAPI_ in the server Admin UI. 


### APIs available in Signal K server v2.0.0 and later:

APIs are available via `/signalk/v2/api/<endpoint>`
