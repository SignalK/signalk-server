# Runtime Environment & Options

Signal K Server provides the following command line options and environment variables to configure your implementation.



## Command line options

| Option | Description |
|--- |--- |
| `-s` | Override path to the settings file. _(same as `SIGNALK_NODE_SETTINGS` environment variable)_ |
| `-c` | Override the path to find server configuration. _(same as `SIGNALK_NODE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable)_  |
| `--sample-nmea0183-data` | Starts signalk-server with sample NMEA0183 data. |
| `--sample-n2k-data` | Starts signalk-server with sample NMEA2000 data. |
| `--override-timestamps` | Override timestamps in the sample NMEA2000 data with current date and time. Doesn't apply nor makes a difference to NMEA0183 sample data. |
| `--securityenabled` | Enable security. For a fresh install this makes the Admin UI force the user to create an admin account before he/she can continue further into the UI. See [Security](../security.md#enabling-security) for further details. |



## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|--- |--- |
| `PORT` | Override the port for http/ws service (default is 3000). |
| `SSLPORT` | Override the port for https/wss service. If defined forces ssl as default protocol _(default port is 3443)_. |
| `PROTOCOL` | Override http/https where the server is accessed via https but the server sees http _(e.g. when Heroku handles https termination)_ |
| `EXTERNALPORT` | The port used in /signalk response and Bonjour advertisement. Has precedence over configuration file. |
| `EXTERNALHOST` | The host used in /signalk response and Bonjour advertisement. Has precedence over configuration file. |
| `FILEUPLOADSIZELIMIT` | Override the file upload size limit _(default is '10mb')_. |
| `NMEA0183PORT` | Override the port for the NMEA 0183 over tcp service _(default is 10110)_. |
| `TCPSTREAMPORT` | Override the port for the Signal K Streaming (deltas) over TCP. |
| `TCPSTREAMADDRESS` | Override the address the Signal K Stream (deltas) over TCP is listening on. |
| `DISABLEPLUGINS` | Disable all plugins so that they can not be enabled _(default is false)_. |
| `DEFAULTENABLEDPLUGINS` | A comma separated list of plugin ids that are overridden to be enabled by default if no setttings exist. Lower preference than `DISABLEPLUGINS`. |
| `PLUGINS_WITH_UPDATE_DISABLED` | A comma separated list of plugin that will not be updated. |
| `SECURITYSTRATEGY` | Override the security strategy module name. |
| `WSCOMPRESSION` | Compress websocket messages _(default is false)_. |
| `MAXSENDBUFFERSIZE` | The maximum number of bytes allowed in the server's send buffer of a WebSocket connection. The connection will be terminated if this is exceeded. Guards against slow or dysfunctional clients that can not cope with the message volume _(default is 512 * 1024 bytes)_. |
| `SIGNALK_SERVER_IS_UPDATABLE` | Allows the server to be updated through the GUI even if it is not installed in the standard paths _(default is false)_. If set to true, the server must have been installed with `npm install -g signalk-server`. |
| `SIGNALK_DISABLE_SERVER_UPDATES` | Disables server updates in the GUI _(default is false)_. |
| `DEBUG` | A comma-separated list of tags for debugging the specified module _(e.g signalk-server*,signalk-provider-tcp)_. Can now be defined directly in the graphical interface.  More help on how to use the debug here: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug#wildcards` |
| `IS_IN_DOCKER` | Used to tell the server it is in Docker and not normally updateable _(default is false)_. |
| `NPMREGISTRYTIMEOUT` | How long to wait for the registry when retrieving the App Store listing _(default is 20s)_. |
| `SECRETKEY` | A secret string used to generate an authentication token _(the internal default autogenerated is a string of 512 hex chars like 'ef8307a4c7a4bd7...309d947bca3')_ |
| `ALLOW_DEVICE_ACCESS_REQUESTS` | Used when a device needs to gain access to a secured Signal K server _(default is true)_ (https://signalk.org/specification/1.4.0/doc/access_requests.html). |
| `ALLOW_NEW_USER_REGISTRATION` | _(default is true)_. |
| `ADMINUSER` | Force an account for admin user _(username:password format)_. |
| `PRESERIALCOMMAND` | Command to run before opening a serial port. |
| `SIGNALK_NODE_SETTINGS` | Override the path to the settings file. |
