# Working with the Resources API


## Overview

The SignalK specification defines a number of resources (routes, waypoints, notes, regions & charts) each with its  path under the root `resources` path _(e.g. `/signalk/v1/api/resources/routes`)_.

The SignalK server validates requests to these resource paths and passes them to a [Resource Provider plugin](RESOURCE_PROVIDER_PLUGINS.md) for the data to be retrieved / stored. 

 _You can find plugins in the `App Store` section of the server admin UI._

Client applications can then use HTTP requests to resource paths to store and retrieve resource entries. _Note: the ability to store resource entries is controlled by the server security settings so client applications may need to authenticate for write / delete operations to complete successfully._


### Retrieving Resources
---

Resource entries are retrived by submitting an HTTP `GET` request to the relevant path.

_Example:_
```typescript
HTTP GET 'http://hostname:3000/signalk/v1/api/resources/routes'
```
to return a list of available routes OR
```typescript
HTTP GET 'http://hostname:3000/signalk/v1/api/resources/routes/urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:94052456-65fa-48ce-a85d-41b78a9d2111'
```
to retrieve a specific resource entry.

When retrieving a list of entries these can be filtered based on certain criteria such as:

- being within a bounded area
- distance from vessel
- total entries returned.

This is done by supplying query string key | value pairs in the request.

_Example 1: Retrieve waypoints within 50km of the vessel_
```typescript
HTTP GET 'http://hostname:3000/signalk/v1/api/resources/waypoints?distance=50000'
```
_Note: the distance supplied is in meters_.

_Example 2: Retrieve the first 20 waypoints within 90km of the vessel_
```typescript
HTTP GET 'http://hostname:3000/signalk/v1/api/resources/waypoints?distance=90000&limit=20'
```
_Note: the distance supplied is in meters_.

_Example 3: Retrieve waypoints within a bounded area._
```typescript
HTTP GET 'http://hostname:3000/signalk/v1/api/resources/waypoints?bbox=-135.5,38,-134,38.5'
```
_Note: the bounded area is supplied as bottom left & top right corner coordinates in the form swLongitude,swLatitude,neLongitude,neLatitude_.


### Deleting Resources
---

Resource entries are deleted by submitting an HTTP `DELETE` request to a path containing the id of the resource to delete.

_Example:_
```typescript
HTTP DELETE 'http://hostname:3000/signalk/v1/api/resources/routes/urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:94052456-65fa-48ce-a85d-41b78a9d2111'
```

In this example the route with the supplied id is deleted from storage.

### Creating / updating Resources
---

Resource entries are created by submitting an HTTP `POST` request to the relevant API path that does NOT include a resource `id`. In this instance the resource is created with an `id` that is generated by the server.

The generated `id` is returned in the response message.

_Example:_
```JSON
{
  "state": "COMPLETED",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": "urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:94052456-65fa-48ce-a85d-41b78a9d2111"
}
```

___Note: Each `POST` will generate a new `id` so if the resource data remains the same duplicate resources will be created.___

_Example: Create a new route._
```typescript
HTTP POST 'http://hostname:3000/signalk/v1/api/resources/set/route' {..}
```

Resource entries are updated by submitting an HTTP `PUT` request to  path that includes a resource `id`.

_Example: Update a route entry._
```typescript
HTTP PUT 'http://hostname:3000/signalk/v1/api/resources/set/route/urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:94052456-65fa-48ce-a85d-41b78a9d2111'  {..}
```

The body of both `POST` and `PUT` requests should contain valid  resource data for the specific resource type in the API path.

Each resource type has a specific set of attributes that are required to be supplied before the resource entry can be created or updated.

___Note: When submitting data to create or update a resource entry, the submitted resource data is validated against the Signal K schema for that resource type. If the submitted data is deemed to be invalid then the operation is aborted.___

___Additionally when supplying an id to assign to or identify the resource on which to perform the operation, the id must be valid for the type of resource as defined in the Signal K schema.___
