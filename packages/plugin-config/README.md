# @signalk/plugin-config

Used within the [Signal K](http://signalk.org) [Node Server](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node) to render plugin configuration forms in the admin interface.

This is its own package so when its installed the javascript asset files come compiled. It makes the build process from the git repo easier and more efficient.
