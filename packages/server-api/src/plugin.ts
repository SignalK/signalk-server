 * - Provide access to resources such as `route,` `waypoint`,`POI`, or `charts` via the _[Resources API](../../../docs/develop/rest-api/resources_api.md)_ by operating as a _[Resources Provider Plugin](../../../docs/develop/plugins/resource_provider_plugins.md)_.
 * - Perform common autopilot operations by acting as an [Autopilot Provider Plugin](../../../docs/develop/plugins/autopilot_provider_plugins.md)
 * - Perform course calculations by integrating with the [Course API](../../../docs/develop/rest-api/course_api.md).
