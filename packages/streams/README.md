# @signalk/streams

Used within the [Signal K](http://signalk.org) [Node Server](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node) for streaming and converting input data in different formats.

The code is not compiled and is not more effective, but allows using the streams and their conversions independently outside the server.

## Development

* Install dev packages with `npm i`.
* Edit files with `/src`.
* `npm link`
* `cd ../../`
* `npm link @signalk/streams`
* Restart signalk `npm start`
