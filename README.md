An implementation of a [Signal K](http://signalk.org) server in Node.js. Intended to run on embedded devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone or UDOO).

The server multiplexes data from NMEA0183, NMEA 2000, Signal K and sensor inputs (eg. I2C connected sensors) and provides the data in Signal K format over HTTP, WebSocket and TCP. It also functions as a NMEA0183 server over TCP.

The server's capabilities can be expanded with the help of plugins that provide additional features such as
* conversion to NMEA2000
* conversion to NMEA0183
* read and write interfacing with cloud services such as MarineTraffic
* logging to database such as InfluxDb


# Installation

Detailed instructions for [installation on Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/raspberry_pi_installation.md)

Prerequisites
* Node.js version 8 or higher with npm installed

## Use: Install from npm

    $ sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm signalk-server

Now you can start the server with sample data:
* NMEA0183 sample data: `signalk-server --sample-nmea0183-data`
* NMEA2000 sample data: `signalk-server --sample-n2k-data`

To generate your own vessel settings file and configure your Pi to start the server automatically run

    $ sudo signalk-server-setup

## Develop: Install from git

```
git clone https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node.git
cd signalk-server-node
npm install
```

Start the server with sample data:
* NMEA0183 sample data: `bin/nmea-from-file`
* NMEA2000 sample data: `bin/n2k-from-file-js`

This will start the server with a sample configuration file and the server will start playing back data from a sample file under `samples/`. The data is available immediately via the REST interface at https://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/api/.

A simple way to connect to the WebSocket interface from the command line is to install wscat2 and use that:
```
npm install -g wscat2
wscat 'ws://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/stream?subscribe=all'
```

## Provision: Ansible on a Raspberry Pi

[Marinepi-provisioning](https://github.com/tkurki/marinepi-provisioning)Â has useful roles and examples for provisioning Signal K and auxiliary services on a headless Raspberry Pi.


## Use: Run on Docker

You can start a local server on port 3000  with `docker run --name signalk-server --publish 3000:3000 --entrypoint signalk-server signalk/signalk-server-node:latest --sample-nmea0183-data`. Docker is currently aimed at running a local demo server that you can test against, not for real use.

Now what?
---------

Once you have the data streams in place you probably want to use the data or at least see it in a nice format. Some sample plugins and apps are installed during the installation process.
- Apps or Webapps are mainly web pages for accessing the Signal K output such as dashboards, configurable gauges or web maps. See [Webapps doc](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/WEBAPPS.md) for more information.
- If you have internet connectivity for your server App Store in the admin user interfaces shows all the Signal K Plugins and Apps that have been published via npm with the right keywords. It also shows their current status on your server and allows you to install and update these.
- Plugins are web forms to tailor your server to your needs, change parameters or get information from various sources. See [Server Plugins](SERVERPLUGINS.md)

Configuration
=============

Please take a look at the different settings files in the `settings` directory and read the [brief intro](http://blog.emilecantin.com/web/sysadmin/iot/javascript/sailing/2016/03/19/arduino-signalk-part-2.html).

You can specify the settings file via command line with `bin/signalk-server -s <path-to-your-settings-file>`.

You can also configure the path to the settings file with environment variable `SIGNALK_NODE_SETTINGS`.

The http port can be configured separately with environment variable `PORT`. You can also [run on port 80 with systemd](https://github.com/tkurki/marinepi-provisioning/blob/d3d624629799a3b96234a90fc42bc22dae4fd3a2/roles/node-app/templates/node_app_systemd_socket.j2). Environment variable NMEA0183PORT sets the NMEA 0183 tcp port.

Storing Configuration Outside The Server Install Directory
==========================================================
You can store configuration like the settings file, plugin cofiguration and defaults.js in a directory outside of the server install using the `-c` option (or the `SIGNALK_NODE_CONFIG_DIR` env variable).

By default, the server will look for a `settings.json` and a `defaults.json` file in the given directory.

For example, `./bin/signalk-server -c /usr/local/etc/node_server_config`

In this case, the server would look for the settings file at `/usr/local/etc/node_server_config/settings.json`

You can overwrite the default settings file name by specifying the -s argument.

For example, ./bin/signalk-server -c /usr/local/etc/node_server_config -s test_settings.json`

In this case, the server would look for the settings file at `/usr/local/etc/node_server_config/test_settings.json`

Environment variables
---------------------
- `SIGNALK_NODE_SETTINGS` override the path to the settings file
- `SIGNALK_NODE_CONFIG_DIR` override the path to find server configuration files
- `PORT` override the port for http/ws service
- `SSLPORT` override the port for https/wss service. If defined activates ssl as forced, default protocol.
- `EXTERNALPORT` the port used in /signalk response and Bonjour advertisement. Has precedence over configuration file.
- `EXTERNALHOST` the host used in /signalk response and Bonjour advertisement. Has precedence over configuration file.
- `NMEA0183PORT`  override the port for the NMEA 0183 over tcp service (default 10110)
- `TCPSTREAMPORT` override the port for the Signal K Streaming (deltas) over TCP
- `TCPSTREAMADDRESS` override the address the Signal K Stream (deltas) over TCP is listening on
- `DISABLEPLUGINS` disable all plugins so that they can not be enabled
- `DEFAULTENABLEDPLUGINS` a comma separated list of plugin ids that are overridden to be enabled by default if no setttings exist. lower preference than `DISABLEPLUGINS`
- `SECURITYSTRATEGY` override the security strategy module name


Real Inputs
---------------
To hook the server up to your real inputs you need to create a configuration file that connects to your input source and applies the relevant parsers / converters in the provider pipeline.

Inputs are configured as an array of pipedProviders, each with an id and an array of pipeElements. You need to create a pipedProviders entry for each of your inputs. The pipedProvider must include 'id' (name of the interface, e.g. NMEA0183 from AIS could be called "AIS"). The first pipeElement is the source of the data ("providers/serialport" for a serial interface such as USB, "providers/filestream" if the data comes from a file, "providers/tcp" if the source is a TCP port etc.). You will see in the example settings that the second pipeElement is often "providers/liner". This is a pipeElement that splits the input into separate lines and passes one line at a time to the next pipeElement. The final pipeElement or group of pipeElements is where the translation or passing to the server occurs. For NMEA0183, this is "providers/nmea0183-signalk", for N2K (NMEA2000) it is "providers/n2kAnalyzer" and then "providers/n2k-signalk".

There are also special pipeElements such as "providers/log" (see below), and "providers/throttle" which changes the playback from files to the bytes per second rate set in the options. The "providers/execute" pipeElement lets you pass a command to the server, as set in the options.

Each PipeElement is configured with `options`. Different PipeElements use different configuration parameters, like for serialport you can configure baud rate and for udp connection the port.

A PipeElement may require some options entry that is available already in the configuration file (`nmea0183-signalk` needs the self id). This can be accomplished with [optionMappings property](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/5134ce5f48f25b2b270176f39d3e8e530dedb825/settings/volare-udp-settings.json#L34-L43).

You can also use optionMappings property to optionally override `options` entries with command line parameters. For example you can specify the data file for file playback from the command line as `bin/signalk-server -s settings/volare-file-settings.json --nmeafilename=samples/nais400-merrimac.log` with [this configuration](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/5134ce5f48f25b2b270176f39d3e8e530dedb825/settings/volare-file-settings.json#L28-L33).

Look through the examples in the settings folder and copy pipedProviders that suit your setup. You can combine as many as you want. See [multiple sources]( https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/multiple-sources.json) example

Make sure that the settings file you are using is valid JSON. This can be done in an online validator like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/)

### NMEA0183

There is an example settings file for using NMEA 0183 input from a serial device that you can use to start up the server: `bin/signalk-settings -s settings/volare-serial-settings.json`. You can change the `port` and `baudrate` in the [settings file](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/volare-serial-settings.json#L23-L27).


### NMEA 2000 (via NGT-1 & Canboat)

There is an example settings file for N2K from N2K/CANBus. Make sure to change the command option to match the NGT-1 port like in this [example](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/actisense-serial-settings.json#L12)

### Signal K

A provider that handles Signal K deltas can be set up with the following elements:
- a source pipeElement (`providers/filestream`, `providers/serialport`, `providers/tcp`, `providers/udp`)
- `providers/liner`
- `providers/from_json`

Furthermore you can use data from a Signal K server with the `providers/mdns-ws` source. Without any configuration it will use the Signal K discovery process to discover any Signal K servers in the local network, such as iKommunicate, and connect to it. No other pipeElements are needed. See the [example configuration file](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/signalk-ws-settings.json). You can also configure `mdns-ws` with `host` and `port`, which will disable the discovery process and make it connect directly to the specified server.

### File

An input from a file uses the `providers/filestream`. The options to change are `filename` and `fromAppProperty` ,see [NMEA0183](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/volare-file-settings.json#L23-L34) and [N2K](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/multiple-sources.json#L81-L82) examples.

### Serial

An input from a serial port uses the `providers/serialport` pipeElement. It takes the options `device` and `baudrate` and optionally "toStdout"(see [example](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/volare-serial-settings.json#L25-L26)). `serialport` has an internal line splitter, so a **pipedProvider with serialport as the source does not need `liner` and will not work with one**.

### TCP

`providers/tcp` is a TCP client that can connect to a server and receive input from a TCP socket. It takes the options `host` and `port` (see [example](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/volare-tcp-settings.json#L29-L30)).

### UDP

settings/volare-udp-settings provides an example of NMEA0183 input over UDP port 7777. If you have trouble getting this to work try setting up DEBUG environment variable with `export DEBUG=signalk-server:udp-provider` and sending manually input with netcat `echo  '$IIDBT,034.25,f,010.44,M,005.64,F*27' | nc -4u -w1 localhost 7777`. This should result in the server logging the NMEA sentence it receives. UDP source takes `port` option.

### GPSD

Please see [example settings files](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/volare-gpsd-settings.json).


Bonjour support
---------------

Bonjour support will be enabled by default if your system supports it and has the required software installed. See also https://github.com/agnat/node_mdns#installation for more information.

When Bonjour is enabled the server advertises itself via Bonjour. This means that Bonjour-aware software running in the same network can discover the Signal K server and access it. For example the server shows up in Safari at Bookmarks => Bonjour => Webpages.

You can disable Bonjour/mDNS by adding the entry `"mdns": false` to the config file. See `settings/volare-gpsd-settings.json` for example.

The server can also automatically discover other Signal K devices and connect to them. See `settings/signalk-ws-settings.json` for an example. If the incoming data should be treated as data about `self` the identity in the settings file and in the incoming data need to match or the incoming data should not include context, as the default is `self`.

HTTPS
-----
Https is enabled by default unless you disable it with `"ssl":true` in the [settings file](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/aava-non-ssl-file-settings.json#L9). If no `ssl-key.pem` & `ssl-cert.pem` files are found under settings they will be created. If you need to configure a certificate chain add it in `ssl-chain.pem` under settings.

By default the server listens to both http and https in the same port.

Logging
-------

You can log all the input data in pre-Signal K format by adding the `log` element to your pipeElement pipeline. It creates hourly files with the data from all the configured providers, interleaved/multiplexed with one message per line. The multiplexed log files can be played back with `multiplexedlog` pipeElement element. Please beware the standard discriminators in [multiplexedlog](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/providers/multiplexedlog.js). For extensive use of logging, please see [Cassiopeia](https://github.com/tkurki/cassiopeia-settings/blob/master/signalk-server-settings.json)

Server Plugins
-------

Plugin configuration interface is at [/plugins/configure](http://localhost:3000/plugins/configure/). See [Server Plugins](SERVERPLUGINS.md) for more information.

# Charts

Signal K chart support is provided by the [@signalk/charts-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@signalk/charts-plugin) plugin.

After installing and configuring the plugin from the admin console, use a client app such as [Freeboard SK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@signalk/freeboard-sk) or [Tuktuk Plotter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tuktuk-chart-plotter) to retrieve a list of charts and present them.
