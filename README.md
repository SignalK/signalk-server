SignalK Node Server
================

An implementation of a [Signal K](http://signalk.org) server. Intended to run on embedded devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone or UDOO).

The server multiplexes data from , NMEA 2000, Signal K and sensor inputs (eg. I2C connected sensors) and provides the data in Signal K format over HTTP and WebSocket. In addition it can provide NMEA0183 over tcp and udp.

Get up and running
------------------
Prerequisites
* node and npm installed

See [these instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions) for Node installation on Raspberry Pi.

Get the repo with either `git clone https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node.git`
or as a simple zip file from https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/archive/master.zip and extract it.

Go to the directory where you put the downloaded code and install dependencies with
````
npm install
```
[Firewall giving you trouble?](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Troubleshooting#npm-only-uses-git-and-sshgit-urls-for-github-repos-breaking-proxies)

Start the server with
```
bin/nmea-from-file
```

This will start the server with a sample configuration file and the server will start playing back set of [NMEA 0183](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183) data from file. The data is available immediately via the REST interface at http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/api/.

A simple way to connect to the WebSocket interface from the command line is to install wscat and use that:
```
npm install -g wscat
wscat --connect 'ws://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/stream?stream=delta'
````

If you want to use [NMEA2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_2000) data you need at least [Canboat analyzer](https://github.com/canboat/canboat/wiki/analyzer) to parse NMEA 2000 data to json and [Canboat actisense-serial](https://github.com/canboat/canboat/wiki/actisense-serial) for getting live data from Actisense [NGT-1](http://www.actisense.com/products/nmea-2000/ngt-1/ngt-1).

If you have analyzer available on your PATH you can start the server with a sample NMEA2000 data file with `bin/n2k-from-file`.

For getting live data from your NGT-1 you need to figure out what device path your device is mounted on, edit the configuration file to match you path and start server with `bin/n2k-from-actisense`.

If you have your own n2k data file you can use that with `bin/n2k-from-file --n2kfilename your-file-name`. Beware that the playback rate is limited in bytes per second - if your data file is from a rich N2K environment you may want to adjust the [rate parameter](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/aava-file-settings.json#L27) in the settings file.

Now what? Consumers!
---------------

Once you have the data streams in place you probably want to use the data or at least see it in a nice format. See [Consumers](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/CONSUMERS.md) for details.

Configuration
=============

Please take a look at the different settings files in the `settings` directory.

You can specify the settings file via command line with `bin/signalk-server -s <path-to-your-settings-file>`.

You can also configure the path to the settings file with environment parameter `SIGNALK_NODE_SETTINGS`.

Real Inputs
---------------
To hook the server up to your real inputs you need to create a configuration file that connects to your input source and applies the relevant parsers / converters in the provider pipeline.

Supported inputs & formats
- NMEA0183
- NMEA 2000 (via NGT-1 & Canboat)
- Signal K delta
- File
- Serial
- TCP
- UDP
- GPSD

Please see [example settings files](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/tree/master/settings).


Bonjour support
---------------

Bonjour support is not activated by default, because it requires operating system support that is not present by default on all platforms. You can enable it by installing `mdns` with `npm install mdns` issued in the server's root folder. See also https://github.com/agnat/node_mdns#installation for more information.

Once Bonjour is enabled the server advertises itself via Bonjour. This means that Bonjour-aware software running in the same network can discover the Signal K server and access it. For example the server shows up in Safari at Bookmarks => Bonjour => Webpages.

You can disable Bonjour/mDNS by adding the entry `"mdns": false` to the config file. See `settings/volare-gpsd-settings.json` for example.

HTTPS
-----
You can use a self generated certificate simply by enabling SSL with `"ssl":true` in the [settings file](./tree/master/settings/aava-ssl-file-settings.json). If no `ssl-key.pem` & `ssl-cert.pem` files are found under settings they will be created.
