## Webapps

### 1. Introduction

A Signal K webapp is an HTML5 application that runs on a web browser and is typically loaded from a Signal K server, using its HTTP interface.

### 2. Sample webapps

There are several prototype level [browser based webapps that are installed during the server installation](http://localhost:3000/apps) such as:
- [Instrumentpanel](https://github.com/SignalK/instrumentpanel) - Show your boat's live data with customizable gauges you can hide or move around.
- [freeboard-sk](https://github.com/signalk/freeboard-sk) - Chart plotting webpage
- [sailgauge](https://github.com/signalk/sailgauge) - html page to show sailing-related data on one screen.

Other apps are published on npm, and appear in the App Store (http://localhost:3000/appstore)

### 3. Getting started with your own webapps

The simplest form of a Signal K client is a process or web page that receives and displays the data in some way. The server contains a very simple web page that connects to the server with a WebSocket connection and updates the display as new json messages are received from the server. If you have installed the server and started it with one of the file-based startup scripts in the bin/ directory you can access it at [http://localhost:3000/examples/consumer-example.html](http://localhost:3000/examples/consumer-example.html). The [html code of the web page](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/public/examples/consumer-example.html) is in the examples directory.

If you want to integrate your webapp in the main structure of http://localhost:3000/apps, you should make it installable via npm and add the keyword `signalk-webapp` to your package.json file.
