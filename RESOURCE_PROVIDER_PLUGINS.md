# Resource Provider plugins

_This document should be read in conjunction with [SERVERPLUGINS.md](./SERVERPLUGINS.md) as it contains additional information regarding the development of plugins that facilitate the storage and retrieval of resource data._

To see an example of a resource provider plugin see [resources-provider-plugin](https://github.com/SignalK/resources-provider-plugin/)

---

## Overview

The SignalK specification defines the path `/signalk/v2/api/resources` for accessing resources to aid in navigation and operation of the vessel.

It also defines the schema for the following __Common__ resource types:
- routes
- waypoints
- notes
- regions
- charts

each with its own path under the root `resources` path _(e.g. `/signalk/v2/api/resources/routes`)_.

It should also be noted that the `/signalk/v2/api/resources` path can also host other types of resource data which can be grouped within a __Custom__ path name _(e.g. `/signalk/v2/api/resources/fishingZones`)_.

The SignalK server does not natively provide the ability to store or retrieve resource data for either __Common__ and __Custom__ resource types.
This functionality needs to be provided by one or more server plugins that handle the data for specific resource types.

These plugins are called __Resource Providers__.

The de-coupling of request handling and data storage provides flexibility to persist resource data in different types of storage to meet the needs of your SignalK implementation.

Requests for both __Common__ and __Custom__ resource types are handled by the SignalK server, the only difference being that the resource data contained in `POST` and `PUT` requests for __Common__ resource types is validated against the OpenApi schema.

_Note: A plugin can act as a provider for both __Common__ and __Custom__ resource types._

---
## Server Operation:

The Signal K server handles all requests to `/signalk/v2/api/resources` (and sub-paths), before passing on the request to the registered resource provider plugin.

The following operations are performed by the server when a request is received:
- Checks for a registered provider for the resource type
- Checks that the required ResourceProvider methods are defined
- Performs access control check
- For __Common__ resource types, checks the validity of the `resource id` and submitted `resource data`.

Only after successful completion of all these operations is the request  passed on to the registered resource provider plugin.

---
## Resource Provider plugin:

For a plugin to be considered a Resource Provider it needs to register with the SignalK server the following:
- Each resource type provided for by the plugin
- The methods used to action requests. It is these methods that perform the writing, retrieval and deletion of resources from storage.


### Resource Provider Interface

---
The `ResourceProvider` interface is the means by which the plugin informs the SignalK server each of the resource type(s) it services and the endpoints to which requests should be passed. 

The `ResourceProvider` interface is defined as follows in _`@signalk/server-api`_:

```typescript
interface ResourceProvider {
  type: ResourceType
  methods: ResourceProviderMethods
}
```
where:

- `type`: The resource type provided for by the plugin. These can be either __Common__ or __Custom__ resource types _(e.g. `routes`, `fishingZones`)_ 

- `methods`: An object implementing the `ResourceProviderMethods` interface defining the methods to which resource requests are passed by the SignalK server. _Note: The plugin __MUST__ implement each method, even if that operation is NOT supported by the plugin!_

The `ResourceProviderMethods` interface is defined as follows in _`@signalk/server-api`_:

```typescript
interface ResourceProviderMethods {
  pluginId?: string
  listResources: (query: { [key: string]: any }) => Promise<{[id: string]: any}>
  getResource: (id: string) => Promise<object>
  setResource: (
    id: string,
    value: { [key: string]: any }
  ) => Promise<void>
  deleteResource: (id: string) => Promise<void>
}
```


#### Methods:

---

__`listResources(query)`__: This method is called when a request is made for resource entries that match a specific criteria.

_Note: It is the responsibility of the resource provider plugin to filter the resources returned as per the supplied query parameters._

- `query:` Object contining `key | value` pairs repesenting the parameters by which to filter the returned entries. _e.g. {region: 'fishing_zone'}_

returns: `Promise<{[id: string]: any}>`


_Example resource request:_ 
```
GET /signalk/v2/api/resources/waypoints?bbox=5.4,25.7,6.9,31.2
```
_ResourceProvider method invocation:_

```javascript
listResources(
  {
    bbox: '5.4,25.7,6.9,31.2'
  }
);
```

---
__`getResource(id)`__: This method is called when a request is made for a specific resource entry with the supplied id. If there is no resource associated with the id the call should return Promise.reject.

- `id:` String containing the target resource entry id. _(e.g. 'urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:07894aba-f151-4099-aa4f-5e5773734b99')_

returns: `Promise<object>`

_Example resource request:_ 
```
GET /signalk/v2/api/resources/routes/urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:07894aba-f151-4099-aa4f-5e5773734b99
```
_ResourceProvider method invocation:_

```javascript
getResource(
  'urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:07894aba-f151-4099-aa4f-5e5773734b99'
);
```

---
__`setResource(id, value)`__: This method is called when a request is made to save / update a resource entry with the supplied id. The supplied data is a complete resource record.

- `id:` String containing the id of the resource entry created / updated. _e.g. 'urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:07894aba-f151-4099-aa4f-5e5773734b99'_

- `value:` Resource data to be stored.

returns: `Promise<void>`

_Example PUT resource request:_ 
```
PUT /signalk/v2/api/resources/routes/urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:07894aba-f151-4099-aa4f-5e5773734b99 {resource_data}
```
_ResourceProvider method invocation:_

```javascript
setResource(
  'urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:07894aba-f151-4099-aa4f-5e5773734b99',
  {
    name: 'test route', 
    distance': 8000, 
    feature: {
      type: 'Feature', 
      geometry: {
        type: 'LineString',
        coordinates: [[138.5, -38.6], [138.7, -38.2], [138.9, -38.0]]
      },
      properties:{}
    }
  }
);
```

_Example POST resource request:_ 
```
POST /signalk/v2/api/resources/routes {resource_data}
```
_ResourceProvider method invocation:_

```javascript
setResource(
  '<server_generated_id>',
  {
    name: 'test route', 
    distance': 8000, 
    feature: {
      type: 'Feature', 
      geometry: {
        type: 'LineString',
        coordinates: [[138.5, -38.6], [138.7, -38.2], [138.9, -38.0]]
      },
      properties:{}
    }
  }
);
```

---
__`deleteResource(id)`__: This method is called when a request is made to remove the specific resource entry with the supplied resource id.

- `id:` String containing the target resource entry id. _e.g. 'urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:07894aba-f151-4099-aa4f-5e5773734b99'_

returns: `Promise<void>`

_Example resource request:_ 
```
DELETE /signalk/v2/api/resources/routes/urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:07894aba-f151-4099-aa4f-5e5773734b99
```
_ResourceProvider method invocation:_

```javascript
deleteResource(
  'urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:07894aba-f151-4099-aa4f-5e5773734b99'
);
```

### Registering a Resource Provider:
---

To register a plugin as a provider for one or more resource types with the SignalK server, it must call the server's `registerResourceProvider` function for each resource type being serviced during plugin startup. 

The function has the following signature:

```typescript
app.registerResourceProvider(resourceProvider: ResourceProvider)
```
where:
- `resourceProvider`: is a reference to a `ResourceProvider` object containing the __resource type__ and __methods__ to receive the requests.

_Note: If a plugin has already registered as a provider for a resource type, the method throws with an `Error`._

_Example:_
```javascript
import { ResourceProvider } from '@signalk/server-api'

module.exports = function (app) {

  const plugin = {
    id: 'mypluginid',
    name: 'My Resource Providerplugin'
  }

  const routesProvider: ResourceProvider = {
      type: 'routes',
      methods: {
        listResources: (params) => { 
          fetchRoutes(params)
          ... 
        },
        getResource: (id) => { 
          getRoute(id)
          ... 
        },
        setResource: (id, value )=> { 
          saveRoute(id, value)
          ... 
        },
        deleteResource: (id) => { 
          deleteRoute(id, value)
          ...
        }
      }
    }

  const waypointsProvider: ResourceProvider = {
      type: 'waypoints',
      methods: {
        listResources: (params) => { 
          fetchWaypoints(params)
          ... 
        },
        getResource: (id) => { 
          getWaypoint(id)
          ... 
        },
        setResource: (id, value )=> { 
          saveWaypoint(id, value)
          ... 
        },
        deleteResource: (id) => { 
          deleteWaypoint(id, value)
          ...
        }
      }
    }

  plugin.start = function(options) {
    ...
    try {
      app.registerResourceProvider(routesProvider)
      app.registerResourceProvider(waypointsProvider)
    }
    catch (error) {
      // handle error
    }
  }

  return plugin
}
```

### Methods 

A Resource Provider plugin must implement methods to service the requests passed from the server.

All methods must be implemented even if the plugin does not provide for a specific request.

Each method should return a __Promise__ on success and `throw` on error or if a request is not serviced.



```javascript
// SignalK server plugin 
module.exports = function (app) {

  const plugin = {
    id: 'mypluginid',
    name: 'My Resource Providerplugin',
    start: options => { 
      ... 
      app.registerResourceProvider({
        type: 'waypoints',
        methods: {
          listResources: (params) => { 
            return new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
              ...
              if (ok) {
                resolve(resource_list)
              } else {
                reject( new Error('Error fetching resources!'))
              }
            })
          },
          getResource: (id) => { 
            return new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
              ...
              if (ok) {
                resolve(resource_list)
              } else {
                reject( new Error('Error fetching resource with supplied id!'))
              }
            })
          },
          setResource: (id, value )=> { 
            throw( new Error('Not implemented!')) 
          },
          deleteResource: (id) => { 
            throw( new Error('Not implemented!')) 
          }
        }
      })
    }

  }
}
```
